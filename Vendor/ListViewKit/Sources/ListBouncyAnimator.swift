/// The elastic lag rows show while the list scrolls — BouncyLayout's physics,
/// carried over verbatim onto ``ListRowAnimator``.
///
/// One spring **per row**, attached to the slot the list placed it at, exactly
/// as the original attaches a `UIAttachmentBehavior` to every visible cell.
/// A frame of scrolling displaces each row by the scroll delta scaled by its
/// distance from the touch — `|touch − anchor| / 1000`, the original's
/// resistance, capped at the full delta — and the spring then pulls the row
/// back to its slot. Rows near the hand move rigidly with the scroll; far
/// ones trail and catch up.
///
/// The pump is deliberately **not** gated on the hand. The original feeds
/// every bounds change through the same formula — a drag, momentum, a
/// rubber-band — using the pan gesture's last known location as the touch,
/// which is precisely what ``ListAnimatorContext/interactionAnchorY`` holds
/// while momentum carries on. Gating on `isUserInteracting` was the previous
/// model's choice, and it is one of the visible differences between the two.
///
/// What maps where:
/// - `UIAttachmentBehavior` (damping, frequency) → the solver the behaviour
///   runs on. UIKit Dynamics is Box2D underneath, and an attachment with a
///   damping and a frequency is its soft constraint: ω = 2πf, ζ = damping,
///   integrated semi-implicitly one step per frame — ``step(_:by:)`` is that
///   arithmetic, not a stand-in for it.
/// - `prepare()` adding behaviours for cells entering the buffered viewport →
///   a row unseen by `update` attaches on first sight, at its slot, holding no
///   displacement — the original anchors at the cell's current centre.
/// - behaviours removed once a cell leaves → followers unseen for a while are
///   pruned; the list stops offering a row the moment it unmounts.
/// - `shouldInvalidateLayout(forBoundsChange:)` → ``willUpdate(_:)``, whose
///   `scrollDelta` is the same bounds travel with compensation already
///   subtracted.
/// - `floor(item.center)` after each pump → dropped, deliberately. It exists
///   to pixel-align `UICollectionView` cell frames; on a transform channel it
///   only quantised the motion into visible 1pt stairs. See ``pump``.
/// - `VIEWPORT_BUFFER` (200pt) → ``maximumDisplacement``, which is what the
///   list overscans its mounting rectangle by.
/// - the original tears down and re-adds every behaviour when a visible cell
///   changes size → a row whose slot moved is re-anchored in place, keeping
///   its displacement, which is the same repair without the one-frame pop.
///
/// Nothing here knows about views or time sources beyond the context handed
/// in. Not `Sendable`: the board it stores is shared mutable state.
