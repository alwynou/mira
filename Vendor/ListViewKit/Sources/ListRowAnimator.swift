/// Displaces rows on top of where the list put them.
///
/// The list places rows; an animator moves them away from there. That split is
/// the whole contract: the engine's geometry is decided before an animator is
/// consulted and is handed over as an argument, so an implementation never
/// takes part in layout and never has to reproduce what the list does when it
/// places a row. ``ListRowView/placedFrame`` stays the truth throughout.
///
/// Every requirement has a default, and the default for `update` does nothing,
/// so an animator that overrides one method is a complete animator.
///
/// Everything a displacement has to be reconciled with is the list's job, not
/// the implementation's: which offset writes count as travel, clamping the
/// frame duration, widening the mounting rectangle, keeping the display link
/// alive, clearing a recycled row, and splitting the frame from the layout
/// passes. What arrives here is a clean scroll delta. An extension point that
/// made every implementation handle deferred-measurement compensation would be
/// a trap rather than an extension point.
