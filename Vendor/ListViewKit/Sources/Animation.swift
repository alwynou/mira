//  Two rules hold this file together:
//
//  1. The list animates only what it said to animate. A list update routinely
//     runs inside somebody else's animation — the keyboard pattern wraps
//     `layoutIfNeeded()` in a block, and the whole layout pass happens in
//     there — so ownership has to be passed down explicitly rather than read
//     off the ambient context, which cannot tell the two apart.
//  2. Placing a view is not moving it. A view that was not on screen has no
//     previous position worth interpolating from.
